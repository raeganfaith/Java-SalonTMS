## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>


The Salon Transaction Management System (TMS) is a desktop application developed to streamline and manage transaction processes for beauty salons. It features a user-friendly GUI that allows salon staff to interact with transaction data, manage payments, and oversee other operational tasks. The system stores all transaction data in a back-end SQL database, ensuring accuracy and security.

Built using Java and Eclipse IDE, with a MySQL or MSSQL database, the Salon TMS is designed to handle the daily operations of a salon efficiently, from tracking payments to managing booking reservations. The application can help salon owners maintain an organized system for customer transactions and services.

This project was developed by Raegan Faith Paguirigan, who took on the challenge of creating the system solo. Initially intended for a group project during the developer's second year of college, Raegan decided to take full ownership of the project as a personal challenge. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) was developed using Eclipse, with icon customization done using Adobe Illustrator. For database management, Raegan used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 to store and manage transaction data. The entire project was completed within an estimated time frame of two weeks.


## Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>

- **Transaction Management**: Track and store transaction records such as payments, services, and customer details.
- **Database Integration**: Securely store transaction data in a MySQL or MSSQL database.
- **Intuitive GUI**: Provide an easy-to-use interface for both salon staff and administrators to interact with transaction records.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Improve salon operations with automated transaction data entry and management.
- **Reporting**: Enable users to generate reports on transactions, payments, and service bookings.

## Significance of the Project <a name="significance"></a>

This Salon Transaction Management System simplifies daily operations for beauty salons by offering an easy-to-use interface to manage transactions, services, and bookings. The integration with a MySQL/MSSQL database ensures secure storage of all transaction data, which helps salon owners maintain accurate records and make informed business decisions. This project can benefit small and medium salons by improving efficiency and reducing manual data entry errors.

## Scope and Limitation <a name="scope-and-limitation"></a>

**Scope**:
- Transaction tracking and payment management for salon services.
- Admin dashboard to manage transactions and account data.
